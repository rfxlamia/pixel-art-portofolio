## Problem Statement & Genesis

### The Legal AI Crisis
The project was born from a specific observation in Indonesian legal education: **students using ChatGPT for legal assignments were receiving confident but fundamentally wrong legal answers**, misleading both students and professors. This highlighted a systemic problem in legal AI deployment.

### Market Reality Assessment
**Current Legal AI Limitations:**
- **Harvey AI (Industry Leader):** 6% improvement over OpenAI v3, yet still operates with significant hallucination rates
- **Industry-Wide Hallucination:** 69-88% error rate on specific legal queries
- **Fundamental Flaw:** Existing systems are "sophisticated search engines masquerading as lawyers"
- **Missing Element:** No system understands what makes legal reasoning actually legal

### Indonesian Employment Law Complexity
**Target Problem Domain:**
- **130+ million Indonesian workers** affected by Omnibus Law (UU Cipta Kerja)
- **1100+ page consolidated document** from 70-90 pages of various employment laws
- **Complex regulatory hierarchy:** UU 13/2003 (foundational) + UU 6/2023 (Cipta Kerja) + PP 35/2021 (implementation)
- **Information asymmetry:** Legal literacy barriers preventing access to employment rights

## Project Aequitas: Constitutional AI Framework

### Core Philosophy
**"Aequitas: Because Justice Deserves Precision"**

The project is built on three foundational principles:
1. **AI tidak boleh halusinasi** (AI must not hallucinate)
2. **Keadilan, presisi, dan anti-bias epistemik** (Justice, precision, and anti-epistemic bias)
3. **Grounded reasoning with constitutional compliance** (All outputs must be constitutionally compliant)

### Revolutionary Multi-Layer Architecture

**Six-Layer Legal Embedding System:**
1. **Lexical Layer:** Indonesian legal terminology processing (force majeure as single concept, not two French words)
2. **Article/Clause Layer:** Hierarchical legal structure navigation (Article-Paragraph-Point recognition)
3. **Legal Concept Layer:** Abstract legal principle embeddings (justice, certainty, utility)
4. **Jurisdictional Layer:** Constitutional supremacy modeling (UUD 1945 → UU → PP → Perpres hierarchy)
5. **Temporal Layer:** Legal temporal validity tracking (effective dates, retroactive vs. prospective application)
6. **Contextual Layer:** Domain-specific application (employment vs. criminal vs. civil contexts)

### Multi-Agent Constitutional Validation

**Agent Ecosystem within Project Aequitas:**
- **Vocana (Employment Law Specialist):** Primary agent for Indonesian employment law
- **Custos (Constitutional Guardian):** Cross-domain constitutional principle validation
- **Nomos (Contract Whisperer):** Civil law and contract analysis
- **Praesidium (Criminal Justice Navigator):** Criminal law reasoning assistant
