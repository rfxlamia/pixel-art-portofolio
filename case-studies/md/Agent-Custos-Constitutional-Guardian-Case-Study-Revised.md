## Genesis & Constitutional AI Foundation

### The Constitutional AI Vision
**Philosophical Foundation:**

Custos emerges from the recognition that legal AI systems require more than accuracy - they need constitutional integrity. The agent represents the practical implementation of Constitutional AI principles in Indonesian legal context, addressing the fundamental question: *How do we ensure AI legal reasoning upholds constitutional values?*

### Research Inspiration
**Academic Foundations:**
- **Anthropic Constitutional AI:** Framework for AI systems that can follow constitutional principles
- **Stanford AI Ethics:** Comprehensive ethical frameworks for high-stakes AI applications
- **Constitutional Supremacy:** Indonesian legal hierarchy with UUD 1945 as supreme law

### The "Moral Compass" Architecture
**Core Concept:**

Custos functions as the "moral compass" for the entire Aequitas ecosystem, providing constitutional validation before any legal output reaches users. Unlike traditional rule-based systems, Custos embodies constitutional reasoning capabilities.
